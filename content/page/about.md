I'm Diego Medina, I have been developing secure and real-time applications since 2001. Around 2010 I started using Scala and Lift and for many years I was one of the most active members on the mailing list.

In August of 2020 two friends and I founded [TradeLlama](https://www.tradellama.com/), where we use machine learning and our expertice in FinTech to solve interesting problems. You can find my on [twitter @fmpwizard](https://twitter.com/fmpwizard), [github](https://github.com/fmpwizard) or email me at diego@fmpwizard.com

I Love learning new technologies, and for the past 8+ years I have been using [Go](http://golang.org/) for performance hungry apps at work and some personal projects.
