I'm Diego Medina, I have been developing secure and real-time applications since 2001. Around 2010 I started using Scala and Lift and for many years I was one of the most active members on the mailing list.

I'm  now the VP of Engineering at [Ascendant Compliance Manager](https://www.ascendantcompliancemanager.com/) and you can find my on [twitter @fmpwizard](https://twitter.com/fmpwizard), [github](https://github.com/fmpwizard) or email me at diego@fmpwizard.com

I Love learning new technologies, and for the past 6+ years I have been using [Go](http://golang.org/) for performance hungry apps at work and some personal projects.
