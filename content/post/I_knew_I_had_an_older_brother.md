There were many things I considered wrong when I was a child. One of them was knowing, in my Soul, that I had an older brother, but my
family denied it and I didn't have any physical proof.

I remember countless afternoons, sitting at the kitchen table, trying to figure out how to fit an older brother
in our family tree. My mother was pretty young when she had my older sister, and I was convinced he was born before her.

I specially missed him when I had a difficult day at school, when I could really use some good advice from someone like me, but
with more experience.

I eventually turned 18, moved to the US and at that point I didn't feel I needed him as much. Not that I knew what I was doing, but I had 
some friends who I could rely on and at that time I was still talking to my father.

### The Chills!

Since I started taking mentoring sessions with [Fauna Speak](https://www.faunaspeak.com/book-a-session/mentorship), I noticed that when I'm 
really connected to Spirit, I get a serious chill. I've been using this to tell a true message apart from my mind messing with me. This also happens
when practice healing, it's like a feedback loop, I dial into the Spirit World, I connect with the Souls that are around us all the time, and the chill 
tells me I have dial tone.

How is that related to my lost older brother? Let me tell you, today, while I was taking a shower, I remembered the feeling of 
my lost older brother, and right there, I got the message that I, now, in 2019, am my older brother! And I got one of those chills I told you about.

Let me explain, you may have heard that "time is an illusion." It's not an easy to grasp idea, after all, we have watches that tell the time,
we get old, die, we have books about history, etc. All that evidence makes it looks like time is pretty real! But, the way I'm looking at it now is that the idea that
time is linear is not the whole truth.

A few days ago I watched a video where Dolores Cannon described time, and the illusion of it, with an intercontinental phone call. Back in the day, to communicate 
from Europe to the US, you had to sail across the ocean, which took a long time. Now, your voice takes a few milliseconds to go the same distance by phone/online chat.
The distance is the same, but the medium we use is different. The same thing happens with time, day to day, we see time going in one direction, but we all
have a way to cross the boundaries of time, and go back in time, at least with our thoughts (maybe physical too, I'll let you know if/when I find out.)

All that to say that the adult me, in 2019, who has a lot of experience, compared to my younger self, and who knows that I "made it," has been helping my
younger self all along. Every time I work through a difficult memory of my past, that healing crosses the time limits we think exists, and reaches
young Diego and gives him the strength I was looking for when I was a kid.

And that's not all, that version of me that was 9 years old, and needed help with kids at school, he "is happening now." This is something else I had
heard other people say, but didn't really click until I heard Dolores Cannon's experience writing the book "Conversations with Nostradamus." The super short version 
is that while she was doing hypnosis with her clients, she ended up being contacted by Nostradamus, but not with his soul, instead, as the person who was
alive in France. You can read more about that experience on her [website](https://dolorescannon.com/about/).

### Now What?

This is a whole new world for me, I feel I finally got an answer to one of my biggest questions. And at the same time, I want to explore this
area of life more. This also means that my even older self is helping me now, because I still struggle with a range of topics in my life.

Tonight, I have more hope than before, not only do I have my Earth family, kids, wife, cats, I also have my Soul family and turns out I have my many versions 
of myself :)


Until next time.
