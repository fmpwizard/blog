# Debugging Lift applications using IntelliJ 11 and SBT

From time to time someone will come to the Lift mailing list asking how to debug their applications from an IDE. I have to confess that most of the time I simply use println or write a spec2 test.

But today I decided to just go ahead and write a little intro on how to setup sbt and intelliJ IDEA 11 to debug a Lift application (and for that matter, debug any application running from sbt.

You can find the article on the Lift [wiki](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Debugging_with_IntelliJ_IDEA_11)

Feel free to edit the wiki if you find any mistakes or leave a comment here.

Enjoy

  Diego
