#Comet Actors in Lift.

One of my favorite features in Lift is **Comet Actors**, I love how easy they are to reason about, and they work great.

I went ahead and recorded a presentation which focuses just on comet actors. They are split into 3 videos and I hope you find them useful.


##All 3 videos in a playlist:

The slides are on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DY9nCbLtAqwWV3N7V4kZFDxopf_IcTbXOJDxplYmdaU/edit#slide=id.g45ddb00c_0_38) (they are all 3 parts in one file.)
